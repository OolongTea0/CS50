        <h1>My First Blog (8/23/2019)</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>
            I've always wanted to be able to express myself online and figured blogging would
            be a good medium for it. It's a great way to show people what you're thinking.
            This blog is going to be a time capsule for my reflections. Fair warning though,
            my writing is going to be awful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to keep this first blog short in particular and just list goals that I
            plan on accomplishing. Future me... you got your work cut out for you. Good luck!
        </p>
